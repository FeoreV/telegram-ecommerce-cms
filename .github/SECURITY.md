## 🛡️ Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

### Application Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection + CSP headers
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt

### Infrastructure Security

- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault integration
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Enforced in production
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/staging/production environments
- **Docker Security**: Non-root containers, security scanning
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules, network isolation

### Monitoring & Logging

- **Security Logging**: All security events are logged
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log of sensitive operations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for security incidents
