Key workflow components:

1. Cart Processing (90/100)
`bot/src/handlers/cartHandler.ts`
- Multi-store shopping cart with cross-currency support
- Store-specific product grouping
- Variant support with dynamic pricing
- Automatic currency conversions between stores

2. Order State Machine (95/100)
`backend/src/utils/orderStateMachine.ts`
- Custom state progression: PENDING_ADMIN -> PAID -> SHIPPED -> DELIVERED
- Automated inventory updates on state changes
- Payment verification requirements before status advancement
- Store-specific order routing

3. Payment Verification (85/100)
`frontend/src/components/orders/PaymentVerificationScreen.tsx`
- Manual admin verification workflow
- Payment proof image validation
- Multi-currency payment amount validation
- Store-specific verification queues

4. Inventory Management (88/100)
`backend/src/controllers/inventoryController.ts`
- Real-time stock updates on order confirmation
- Automatic stock restoration on order cancellation
- Low stock alerts with configurable thresholds
- Cross-store inventory tracking

5. Order Notifications (82/100)
`bot/src/handlers/notificationHandler.ts`
- Status-based notification routing
- Store-specific notification templates
- Multi-channel delivery (Telegram, email)
- Custom notification priorities

Core Business Rules:
1. Orders require manual payment verification by store admin
2. Stock levels update only after payment verification
3. Each store can define custom verification requirements
4. Order notifications follow store-specific templates
5. Cross-currency orders maintain original payment amounts
