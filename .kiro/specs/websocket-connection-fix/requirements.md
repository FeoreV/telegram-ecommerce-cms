# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the WebSocket connection error ("xhr poll error") between the frontend and backend applications. The issue stems from misconfigured environment variables that prevent the frontend from establishing a proper Socket.IO connection to the backend server. The solution will ensure reliable real-time communication between the frontend and backend components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend WebSocket Configuration

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to connect to the correct backend WebSocket endpoint, so that real-time communication can be established successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application initializes THEN it SHALL use the correct backend URL with port number for WebSocket connections
2. WHEN the VITE_SOCKET_URL environment variable is read THEN it SHALL include the complete URL with protocol, host, and port (e.g., http://localhost:3001)
3. IF the backend is running on a non-standard port THEN the frontend SHALL include that port in the Socket.IO connection URL
4. WHEN the Socket.IO client is configured THEN it SHALL use the VITE_SOCKET_URL or fallback to VITE_API_URL for connection

### Requirement 2: Backend CORS Configuration

**User Story:** As a backend server, I want to accept WebSocket connections from authorized frontend origins, so that cross-origin requests are properly handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection request arrives THEN the backend SHALL validate the origin against the CORS_WHITELIST
2. WHEN the CORS_WHITELIST is configured THEN it SHALL include all valid frontend URLs (with and without ports)
3. IF the frontend is running on localhost with a specific port THEN that exact origin SHALL be included in CORS_WHITELIST
4. WHEN Socket.IO is initialized THEN it SHALL use the CORS configuration from environment variables

### Requirement 3: Environment Variable Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent environment variable naming and values across all configuration files, so that connection settings are predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are defined THEN frontend and backend SHALL use consistent URL formats
2. WHEN the FRONTEND_URL is set in backend THEN it SHALL match the actual frontend origin including protocol and port
3. IF multiple environment files exist (.env, backend/.env, frontend/.env) THEN they SHALL have consistent and non-conflicting values
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log the configured connection URLs for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4: Connection Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want clear error messages when WebSocket connection fails, so that I can understand and resolve connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection fails THEN the frontend SHALL log the attempted connection URL and error details
2. WHEN the backend rejects a connection THEN it SHALL log the origin and reason for rejection
3. IF a connection error occurs THEN the application SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN debugging connection issues THEN developers SHALL have access to detailed logs showing configuration values

### Requirement 5: Development and Production Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the WebSocket configuration to work in both development and production environments, so that the application functions correctly in all deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the application SHALL use localhost URLs with appropriate ports
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN the application SHALL use the production domain URLs
3. IF the NODE_ENV changes THEN the connection configuration SHALL adapt accordingly
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN the environment variables SHALL be validated before startup
